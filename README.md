## About The Project

I saw a UI design on Dribbble by [Anton Mikhaltsov](https://dribbble.com/shots/9404340-Shop-Clothing-Web-Page) and decided to code this design. I challenged myself to make it a full working website with NextJS in just 1 week. Some issues are still there, but I will address them later.

- Filter and Sort buttons are not working yet.
- ~~Website is not responsive 100% because of time constraints, but I am working on it.~~ Now, it is responsive.
- Firebase functions could be improved.
- The homepage (News In) cards have no redirects and are just placeholders.
